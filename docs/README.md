# Duke User Guide

Duke is a **desktop task management app optimized for use via a Command Line 
Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface 
(GUI). 

If you can type fast, Duke can manage your tasks faster than traditional
GUI apps!

### Quick Start
1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `duke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/Ugholaf/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Duke application.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.

5. Type the command at the bottom and press Send to execute it.
6. Refer to the [Usage](#usage) below for details of each command.

## Features 

### Task Management
Duke helps to manage 3 types of tasks:
- **ToDos**: Tasks without any datetime attached to it
- **Deadline**: Tasks that need to be done before a specific datetime
- **Event**: Tasks that start at a specific time and ends at a specific time

It is supported by the following operations:
- Show a list of tasks
- Add tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as done/undone
- Find tasks

### Autosave
The tasks will be saved to the hard disk automatically whenever the data changes.

## Usage

Notes about the command format:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
- Some commands have a shorter aliases for keywords. The format below will show both keywords for the same command. 
  
   e.g. Both `list` and `l` will display a list of the current tasks.
