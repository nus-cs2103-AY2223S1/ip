### Command Glossary

`CONTENT`/`DESCRIPTION`: Any ASCII string works, but ensure none of the words start with a forward slash, else it would be interpreted as a command modifier. Example: `grocery list` is fine but `groceries meat /fish` is not.

`INDEX`: Any number works, as long it is the index of a task/note. Deleting a task/note will not preserve the index of other tasks/note behind it.

`TIME`: Any string which contains the following keywords would be interpreted as a time if Anthea can resolve the time.
* A time written as HH:MM (24 hours) or HH:MMam or HH:MMpm, or with a period instead of a colon.
* A day of the week, full or abbreviated.
* An ordinal, interpreted as the day of a month (e.g. 1st, 23rd).
* A month name, full or abbreviated.
* A date, written as D/M/Y or D-M-Y.
* A year, written as Y.

Time resolution proceeds as follows:
* A time at or after the present is attempted to be found which matches all the keywords
* If no such time exists, a time before the present but after 1st Jan 1AD 00:00
* If no such time exists, the string is left intact for the benefit of the user.
