# User Guide
Jarvis is **a desktop app for managing tasks** (to-dos, 
deadlines, and events), **optimised for use via a Command 
Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of 
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, 
Jarvis can get your task management done faster than 
traditional GUI apps.
