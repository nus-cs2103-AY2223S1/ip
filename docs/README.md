# The new and improved duke

![Screenshot of Duke](./Ui.png)

Do you every feel like you have too many things to do but no way to keep track of it? That's where duke comes in! Duke simulates a task manager to keep track of your daily life! 

## List of Features
- Add a task without a date associated (todo)
- Add a task with a date associated (deadline/event)
- Deletes Tasks (by index)
-  Marks and unmarks tasks (by index)
- List all tasks in an easy to read list format 
- Views your schedule on a seperate day


## What do I need to use the project?

Prerequisites: JDK 11 [Download and setup guide here!](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)

## How do I set up this project? 
There are 3 simple steps! 

1. Download the latest release from [here!](https://github.com/cowlinn/ip/releases) 
2. Extract the file to a working directory of your choice. 
3. Execute the jar format
   1. Ensure you're on the correct working directory 
   2. Entering the command `java -jar duke.jar` in the terminal 
3. If the setup is correct, you should see a something like this :

## Quick Start
1. To view a list of commands, type `help` into the chatbox, a popup should appear with the relevant commands
2. Some example commands you can try:
    * `list`: Returns a list view of all contacts stored
    * `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current app
    * `todo wash the dishes`: Adds a todo, with the description to wash the dishes 
    
## Using our commands 
Refer to the handy table below to check our our syntax 

| Command Functionality | Syntax Example | Format Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Add todo task | `todo (description)` | todo clean dishes | Adds a todo event to the list |
| Add event task | `event <description> /at <date>`| event submit assignment  /at 2020-05-05 | Adds an event to the list. Notice that these have dates tagged to them, with the syntax: `YYYY-MM-DD`|
| Add Deadline task | `deadline <description> /by <date>` | deadline submit assignment  /at 2020-05-05 | Adds a deadline to the list. Same format as event
| Delete |  `delete <taskListNumber>` |  delete 5 | This deletes the specified task in the list. Note that the tasks go in running order, starting from 1 | 
Find | `find <keyWord(s)>` | find homework | Searches the descriptions of all the tasks in the list, and returns a list view of all the tasks which contain the specified keyword inside. |
| View tasks in List format | `list` | list (no further arguments) | Single word command that returns a list view of the tasks 
| Mark/Unmark tasks | `(un)mark <taskListNumber>` | mark 3 / unmark 4 | Keeps track of whether tasks are done / undone. When loading in a task, it is not done (unmarked by default). Marking adds a cross next to the item in list view, and unmarking does the opposite.
| view schedule on available day | `viewSchedule <date>` | viewSchedule 2022-05-05 | Returns a list view of tasks that happen on that specific day. Do take note of the standard date syntax: `YYYY-MM-DD` |
|View a help sheet| `help`| help | Opens up a document in your browser with all the basic commands |

## Advanced User Saving Guide 

Preview the save file as shown here 
![SaveFile](./SaveScreenShot.png)

 For our more advanced users, you are able to `edit` the save file using the format specified by our save file. Each argument is deliminated by double backslashes `//`. 
> Here's how to edit the save file yourself. The format for each task is specified by: `taskIndicator//0 or 1//description//date (if necessary)//`.

1. Notice that each line of the text file (located under `SavedData/Save.txt` from your current JAR file directory) corresponds to one task 

- The number `0` & `1` represents under `markindicator` indicates whether the task is marked or not.
- The date follows our standard date syntax: `YYYY-MM-DD`. There is no option to add time yet.
- The `description` can be any description of the task 

2. For todo tasks: the format is specified as `T//markIndicator//description`
3. For deadline tasks: The format is specified as `D//markIndicator//description//date`
4. Similarly, for event tasks: The format is specified as `E//markIndicator//description//date`
5. Finally, you can simply delete lines to delete the task, and it will be automatically re-ordered for you

##  Code Reuse

 1. GUI Inspiration and formatting 
 -  @@author `PinranJ` - reused
    - Reused code from batchmate for GUI styling. Specifically, to shape the user profile into a circle
    - Fit my own ratios into the code
    -  {
        `double circleRadius = displayPicture.getFitWidth() / 2;`
        `double circleX = displayPicture.getX() + circleRadius;`
        `double circleY = displayPicture.getY() + circleRadius;`

        `Circle clip = new Circle(circleX, circleY, circleRadius);`

        `dialog.setText(text);`
        `displayPicture.setImage(img);`
        `displayPicture.setClip(clip);`
        }
        

2. Save System implementation

3. Parser switch statements 
 - @@ author `Sergey Kalinichenko` - referenced 
     - Idea to use `toString` method of enums to pass into switch statement for parser

     - `public enum MyType {`

                `public String toString() {`
                    `return "this is my value one";`
