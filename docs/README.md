ðŸ¤©QoobeeðŸ¤© is a **chatbot app for managing and storing tasks, optimised 
for used via a command line interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Java `11` installed.
2. Download the latest version of Qoobee [here](https://github.com/CedricChia123/ip).
3. Copy the `jar` file to the folder you would like to use Qoobee in.
4. Double click the `jar` file to run it.

## Features 
Qoobee records 3 types of tasks:

- ToDos: Tasks that do not have a specific due date.
- Deadlines: Tasks to be done before a specified date and time.
- Events: Tasks that will occur at a date and time.

Qoobee saves the list of tasks as a `.txt` file in the same folder
location, which can be loaded the next time you reopen
the app!

In addition to recording tasks, Qoobee has features to mark and unmark
tasks as completed/not completed, along with marking the priority
level of each task.
