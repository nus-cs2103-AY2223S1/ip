as done. The completion date of the task will be set the current

### `edit TASK_NUMBER EDITED_TASK` - Edits/ Updates a task

Edits (ie: updates) the task in your task list associated to
the specified task number.

The usage depends on the type of task.

Editing a `todo` task: `edit TASK_NUMBER DESCRIPTION`
Editing a `deadline` task: `edit TASK_NUMBER DESCRIPTION /by DUE_DATE`
Editing an `event` task: `edit TASK_NUMBER DESCRIPTION /at START_DATETIME /to END DATETIME`

Note that this command only allows you to update the details of the specified task.
This means that you cannot change the task type with this command.

<img src="images/Edit.png" width="400"/>

Example of usage:

`edit 6 read chapter 3 /by night`

is removed from the task list.

### `stats [-STATISTIC_TYPE_FLAG]` - Generate statistics

Generates statistics for the completed tasks stored in your task
list. Currently supports two types of data visualisation, pie chart
and bar graph. See the following sections on how to generate each
statistic.

Note that if no `[-STATISTIC_TYPE_FLAG]` is provided (ie: command
`stats` is typed), Bobo will simply generate a pie chart.

<img src="images/Stats.png" width="400"/>

Example of usage:

`stats`

Expected outcome:

A pie chart breaking down completed tasks by their task type
will be generated.


### `stats [-p]` - Generate statistics in a pie chart

Generates the breakdown of **all** completed tasks by their task type
in a pie chart. If there are no completed tasks, no pie chart
will be generated.

<img src="images/PieChart.png" width="400"/>

Example of usage:

`stats -p`

Expected outcome:

A pie chart breaking down completed tasks by their task type
will be generated.

### `stats -b [/BAR_CHART_TYPE] [DATE]` - Generate statistics in a bar chart

Generates the breakdown of completed tasks by their completion date
in a bar chart. If there are no completed tasks, no bar chart
will be generated.

There are two types of bar charts supported by Bobo. You can
view either **daily** (`/day`) or **weekly** (`/week`) statistics.
You can specify the type of bar chart to generate with the
`/BAR_CHART_TYPE` tag. If no `/BAR_CHART_TYPE` tag is specified, Bobo will default to a
daily-type bar chart statistic.

In addition, you can also specify the date to view the statistics
for. If no date is specified, Bobo will default to the current day.

For a **day-type bar** chart, this means viewing the breakdown
of tasks completed by hour for that specified day.

<img src="images/BarChartDay.png" width="400"/>

For a **week-type bar** chart, this means viewing the breakdown of
tasks completed by week for the week the specified day falls within.

<img src="images/BarChartWeek.png" width="400"/>

Example of usage:

`stats -b /day yesterday`

Expected outcome:

A bar chart breaking down completed tasks by hour yesterday will
be generated.

Example of usage:

`stats -b /week 21/09/22`

Expected outcome:

A bar chart breaking down completed tasks by day on the week of
21st September 2022 will be generated.

### `schedule [DATE]` - Get the daily schedule

Gets the daily schedule for the specified date. This schedule
will show:
* All incomplete to-dos (since to-dos have no associated 
  datetime, they will be assumed to be on the
  schedule for the day)
* All deadlines that are overdue (incomplete and the due date
  has passed, relative to the specified date) or are due on the
  specified date (even if they are completed)
* All events that are overdue (incomplete but the event has
  passed, relative to the specified date), or that takes place
  during the specified date (even if they are completed)

> ℹ️️ If no date is specified (ie: input command `schedule`),
> Bobo assumes the schedule is to be generated
> for the current day (`schedule today`).

<img src="images/Schedule.png" width="400"/>

Example of usage:

`schedule tmr`

Expected outcome:

A list of tasks scheduled for the next day.

### `bye` - Save data and exits Bobo

Saves the task list locally and exits the program.

Example of usage:

`bye`

Expected outcome:

Saves the task list and exits from Bobo.
