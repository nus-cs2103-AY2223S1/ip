## Usage

### `bye` - Exits the application

Describe the action and its outcome.

Example of usage:

`bye`

Expected outcome:

The application closes. There may or may not be enough time for the exit message (_"See you!"_) to be seen before the application closes.

```
See you!
```

### `list` - Lists all saved tasks

Lists all tasks that are stored in the data file. A task can have one of three types:

- Todos
- Deadlines
- Events

Tasks have a name, and a status indicating whether the task is done or not done.

Example of usage:

`list`

Expected outcome:

A numbered list of tasks, each containing the task type, the task status, the task name, and any other information pertaining to the task.

```
Your Tasks:
1. üìú ‚òê Some Todo
2. ‚Äº ‚òê A Deadline (by 2022-01-23 at
08:00)
3. üìÜ ‚òê This Event (from 2022-01-23 08:00
to 2022-01-23 08:00)
4. üìú ‚òê Another Todo
6. üìú ‚òê Read a book
```

### `delete` - Deletes a task

Deletes a task.

Example of usage:

`delete TASK_NUMBER`, where `TASK_NUMBER` corresponds to the number seen in the `list` command

Expected outcome:

The task will be deleted and removed from the saved data file.

```
Task has been deleted successfully!
```

If the task number is invalid, the application will say the error and no change will be made.

```
Something went wrong when deleting task TASK_NUMBER! Likely, you specified a task number that is out of range.
```

### `mark` - Marks a task as done

Marks (ticks) a task as done, toggling its status.

Example of usage:

`mark TASK_NUMBER`, where `TASK_NUMBER` corresponds to the number seen in the `list` command

Expected outcome:

The task will be marked as done.

```
Task has been marked as done!
```

If an invalid task is specified, be it the task is already done, or the task does not exist, the application will say the error and no change will be made.

```
Task not modified! Either the task is already done, or you specified an invalid task number TASK_NUMBER.
```

### `unmark` - Marks a task as not done

Unmarks (unticks) a task, toggling its status. In other words, marks a task as not done.

Example of usage:

`unmark TASK_NUMBER`, where `TASK_NUMBER` corresponds to the number seen in the `list` command

Expected outcome:

The task will be marked as not done.

```
Task has been marked as done!
```

If an invalid task is specified, be it the task is still not done, or the task does not exist, the application will say the error and no change will be made.

```
Task not modified! Either the task is still not done, or you specified an invalid task number TASK_NUMBER.
```

### `find` - Searches for a task by name

Describe the action and its outcome.

Example of usage:

`find PARTIAL_NAME_WORDS`, where `PARTIAL_NAME_WORDS` are partial words that form the name of the task that the user wants to query.

Expected outcome:

A numbered list of tasks, each containing the task type, the task status, the task name, and any other information pertaining to the task, similar to the output of the `list` command. However, this list of tasks will only contain tasks that match the following criteria:

- Searches are case-insensitive

  E.g.: "tit" matches "Tit", "tIt", "TIT", and so on.

- Every partial-word is present, in order, in the name

  E.g.: "tit b" matches "tit bird", "title bird" and "brown tit bird that lays eggs" and "petite duck", but not "b tit".

```
Finding tasks that match "tle bi"...
```

```
Matching Tasks:
1. üìú ‚òê TiTle bIrd
```

### `todo` - Creates a new todo task item

Example of usage:
