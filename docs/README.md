# User Guide for Sky

Sky is an interactive chatbot for managing tasks, and can be used to track tasks such as deadlines, events, and todos.  
It is backed up by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is optimized for use on it.   
If you have trouble remembering things to do, Sky can free your mind from doing so by acting as a one-stop solution for
tracking tasks.
