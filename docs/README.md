Introducing Nikki, your friendly task manager robot!
## Features

### Manage tasks

You can add a new task or delete an old task. You can also mark a task as completed or unmark it as uncompleted.

### Find tasks

Nikki can help you search for tasks stored in your task list based on the keyword you enter!

### Auto-Save
