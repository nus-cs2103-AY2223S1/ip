## Features

### Modifying saved data
_KarenBot_ stores saved data in a text file named `duke.txt`. Advanced users can directly modify the text files if 
they find it quicker for niche actions such as mass deletion. The text file can be located in
a folder named `data` in _KarenBot_'s folder.

### Safeguarding against data corruption
On the event of a corruption of the text file `duke.txt` due to user modifications and _KarenBot_ is 
unable to parse it, _KarenBot_ can prevent loss of user data by renaming the corrupted
file to `duke-corrupt.txt` and continue to operate in a clean state. Users can then 
attempt to fix the erroneous modification (ensure that the file is renamed back to `duke.txt`). If there exists 
corrupted files already, _KarenBot_ will not overwrite `duke-corrupt.txt`. Instead, an incremental version, e.g.,
`duke-corrupt1.txt` will be created.

## Usage
**Note:** 
- Where angle brackets i.e., `<>`  are used, users must replace them with
appropriate values as specified.
- All time values have to be formatted in this specific format: `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM`.   
Allowed delimiter characters are: `-:.|/`.
- `|` (pipe character) should never be used as an input, as it is used as a delimiter for data storing purposes.
