# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
![](Ui.png)

Duke is a personal chat-bot to help you keep track of your tasks, events, or deadlines.
It is optimized for keyboard users, but has a GUI for the looks as well.

# Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>
- Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
- Download the latest jar from the [release page](https://github.com/RezwanArefin01/ip/releases/).
- Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Duke.
- Make sure the directory has read and write permissions.
- Run `java -jar duke.jar` in a terminal to start Duke. A data directory will be created in the location you execute the command from.
  - Do not use double click to start the application. Because your OS can decide to execute the command from a different place.
- Enter `help` to get started!
- Optional: Install the [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) font for best viewing experience.

# Advanced Features <a name="advanced_features"></a>
## Data File <a name="data_file"></a>
All the data is saved in the file `./data/data.txt`, relative to the directory you execute the jar from.
You can modify task list by directly editing this file. Each line of the file describes one task.
The format is the following:
```
TASK SYMBOL | IS DONE? | DESCRIPTION [| ARGS...]
```
- `TASK SYMBOL` is `T` for todo task, `D` for deadline, and `E` for event tasks.
- `IS DONE?` is 0 or 1 depending whether the task is due or not.
- `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the task.
- Currently, the `ARGS...` take in a date time for deadline and events. The date-time must be in the
format `h-M-yy HHmm`. Specifically, day and month number should not have leading zeros, and year must have
2 digits.

**Example data file:**
```
T | 0 | Return CLRS book to the library.
D | 0 | CS2103T iP. | 16-9-22 2359
E | 0 | CS2103T lecture. | 16-9-22 1800
```

However, do note that if the data file is corrupted, Duke will not startup. It will show you a warning
about the corruption and you can choose to keep the file and investigate, or start with a new file.
