# User Guide

NyanDuke is a cute desktop app for **managing your upcoming tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). :3

## Features 

### Track your tasks

Have a lot of tasks to keep track of?<br>
Add your tasks to NyanDuke and easily recover the full list of tasks you have left!
You can also mark tasks as complete or delete them at any time.

### Transferrable data file

Finally upgrading to that new computer you've wanted?<br>
NyanDuke saves your task data in a file on your hard disk so you can keep your data even if you move computers!

### Find your tasks

Have too many tasks in the list and you want to find something specific? <br>
NyanDuke can find tasks using keywords or by dates so you won't have to scour through the list yourself!

## Usage

### Notes:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo sleep`.

* When the requested parameter is `DATE` or `TIME`, it should be input as given below.<br>
NyanDuke will be unable to recognise your input as a date otherwise, even if it is meant to be a date/time :(
  * `DATE` - Date in year-month-day notation, e.g. `2022-10-22`
  * `TIME` - Time in 24hr clock notation, e.g. `1800`

* When a parameter is trailed by `...`, you can call that parameter multiple times, separating each with whitespace.<br>
  e.g. in `delete TASK_NUMBER ...`, `TASK_NUMBER` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 1` or `delete 1 3 5`.

* The parameter `TASK_NUMBER` refers to the number index of the task as given by the `list` command.
