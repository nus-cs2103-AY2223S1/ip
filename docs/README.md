## Storage
All tasks are automatically saved at `/data/duke.txt` and loaded from the same file on startup.

Advanced users may directly edit the savefile.

**Caution!** If the edited data is of a different format, the file may be **overwritten** and data lost.

### Storage File Format
Tasks are saved line by line in the following structure

`<type>|<mark>|<description[|<time>]`

`<type>` is `T` for Todo, `D` for Deadline, `E` for Event

`<mark>` is `0` if the task is unmarked and `1` if it is marked

`<time>` is only present for Deadlines and Events

Example: `E|0|AI Seminar|2022-10-13 1900`
corresponds to the input `event AI Seminar /at 2022-10-13 1900`
