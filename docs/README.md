# Deadline Duck

## Features 
**Deadline Duck** is a Personal Assistant Chatbot 
that helps you keep track of your upcoming 
tasks, deadlines! Sometimes, when adding tasks, you may be some 
additional thoughts in your mind. Therefore, **Deadline Duck** allows you 
to pen your thoughts with our Notes feature too!

Types of tasks:
* Todos : simple tasks to be completed

* Events : tasks that are scheduled to happen at a certain date
* Notes : notes that you can add to keep track of your thoughts
