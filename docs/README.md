# JARVIS User Guide

<b> JARVIS </b>is a task manager chatbot that helps you keep track of your tasks through a command line style interface. Get stuff done the way Iron Man does!

## Features

### Three task types
- `todo`: A task with a description
- `event`: An event with a description of what and when it is
- `deadline`: A deadline with a description and due date

### Search
Search for tasks using the `find` command

### Mark and unmark
Mark tasks as done or undone using the `mark` and `unmark` commands

## Usage
Parameters for commands (such as descriptions and due dates) are indicated using the `\` symbol e.g `\d`. In effect, you can indicate parameters in any order you like!

When there are issues such as missing parameters, **JARVIS** will inform you appropriately. An example of such a message is as follows (when trying to add an event with no information provided):
```
The following issues occured with your command:
1. This command needs a non-empty description.
2. This command needs an at date
```
Upon exiting, **JARVIS** saves tasks to a folder called `data` which is created wherever you ran the JAR file. The next time you run the JAR file, your tasks are loaded from this folder. **Do not delete this folder or the files inside unless you want to delete all your tasks!**

##  `list` -  Lists all tasks added

#### Example:

`list`

####  Explanation:
An appropriate message is displayed upon sending `list` to the bot - either a list of tasks created or an indication that no tasks have been added, e.g:
```
1. [T] [] Study for midterms
2. [D] [X] Submit iP (by: Sep 19 2022 2359)
```
Each task is prefaced by one letter indicating its type: `T` for todo, `D` for deadline and `E` for event.

Next, there is a `[X]` for tasks that have been marked as done, followed by the task description.

The numbering of the tasks from `list` is used for commands that need a `/id` parameter to specify a task.

##  `todo` -  Adds a todo task

#### Example:

`todo /d Get groceries`
