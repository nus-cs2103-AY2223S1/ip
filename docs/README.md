# Advanced
## Data Storage
All the data is saved in the file `./data/duke.txt`. You can modify task list by directly editing
this file. Each line of the file describes one task. The format is the following:
 ```
<TASK TYPE>,<COMPLETION STATUS>,<DESCRIPTION>,<ARGS...>
 ```
- `TASK Type` is `T` for todo task, `D` for deadline, and `E` for event tasks.
- `COMPLETION STATUS` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the task is completed or not.
- `DESCRIPTION` is the description of the task.
- Currently, `ARGS...` only take in a date for deadline and events. The date must be in the
  format `yyyy-MM-dd`. Specifically, day and month number should not have leading zeros.

Example data file:
 ```
T,1,return book  
E,0,project meeting ,2022-10-11
D,0,finish project,2022-09-15
 ```
