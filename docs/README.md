<!-- <div markdown="block"> -->

**Note about the command format:**<br>

- Command formats are to be followed **strictly**.
<br>
- `[]` denotes an input given by the user. 
eg. For a deadline, `deadline [Task Name] by [Date]`, `[Task Name]` and `[Date]` is given by the user which can be `deadline Submit Resume by 2022-11-11`.
<br>

- Dates should be in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. 
eg. If a user wants to input 14 September 2022, the corresponding input is `2022-09-14`.
<br>

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list, bye and sort) are not allowed.
e.g. If the command specifies list 123, it will be interpreted as list.
