# Uwu Project

UwuBot is a chatbot that helps you keep track of all your tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, UwuBot can get your tasks management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Refer to the [User Guide](docs/README.md) for more details about the features available.
