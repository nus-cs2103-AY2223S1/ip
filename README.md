# DukePro User Guide

DukePro is a desktop app for managing trips and events, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DukePro can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# Quickstart
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest dukepro.jar file.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your DukePro.
4. Create a 'src' folder with a 'dukesave' folder inside of the home folder.
5. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
