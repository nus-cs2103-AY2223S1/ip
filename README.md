# KarenBot

![Ui](docs/Ui.png)

KarenBot is a rude, self entitled desktop chatbot that will help you remember your tasks, all for the low cost of having to deal with her attitude. KarenBot is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). KarenBot is best suited for the quick typist, maximising your productivity by spending less time on handling your tasks!

Check out the [user guide](https://sikai00.github.io/KarenBot/) to learn how to use KarenBot!
