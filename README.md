# Scottie
Scottie is a GUI-based desktop application that can help you manage your tasks. It is built using JavaFX and tested using JUnit. Code quality is enforced using CheckStyle. Continuous Integration has also been set up using GitHub Actions to automate testing.

The application also features a fully functional CLI that is mainly used for additional automated testing using input redirection. The test scripts and test inputs are located in the `text-ui-test` folder.

The latest `scottie.jar` can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/teekaytai/ip/releases). You can view the user guide for instructions on how to set up and use this application [here](https://teekaytai.github.io/ip/).
