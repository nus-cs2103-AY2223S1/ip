## **Henry** is a chatbot that curates a task list for you based on text commands.

Currently, **Henry** supports the following commands:

- **Echo:** repeats the user's input to the console
- **List:** displays the task list in the console
- **Todo:** adds a "to-do" type task to the task list
- **Deadline:** adds a "deadline" type task to the task list
- **Event:** adds an "event" type task to the task list
- **Mark:** marks a task as complete
- **Unmark:** marks a task as incomplete
- **Delete:** deletes a task from the task list
- **Find:** finds any matching tasks given a key word
- **Tentative:** adds a tentative date to any event task 
- **Teach:** interaction feature that supports learning and memory

**Henry** is able to store a task list to the user's desktop. When **Henry** starts up, the following occurs:

1. The user's desktop is checked for an existing storage file. If no file exists, a new file is created.
   (Note: **Henry** does this by using a reference to a user's desktop that will work for ANY **Windows** user)

```java
private static final String home = System.getProperty("user.home");
private static final Path FILE_PATH = java.nio.file.Paths.get(home,"Desktop","henry.txt");
```

2. Tasks are parsed from the file to a list (or an empty list if the file is newly created).
3. The UI is initialised.
4. Start-up complete! ðŸ˜ƒ

To run **Henry**, download the release from **releases**, then open command prompt. Input the following:

```
cd [the path where henry.jar is located]
java -jar henry.jar
```

Note that the release is not updated to handle the "Find" command yet!
