Yo...nice to meet you. This is rabbit...Ughhhhh I hate this job.
You can input stuff that you want me to write on this grandma-aged notebook.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Type the type of a task followed by its content and time to add it into the list.
   There are three types: todo, deadline and event.
   - To add todo, type 'todo the content' such as 'todo do homework'.
   - To add deadline, type 'deadline the content /the time' such as 'deadline do homework /9am'.
   - To add event, type 'event the content /the time' such as 'event do homework /9am'.
2. Type 'list' then I'll show all the existing lines to you.
3. Type 'mark + the index of an existing task' to marks it as done. Like 'mark 1'.
4. Type 'unmark + the index of an existing task' to unmark a task.
5. Type 'delete + the index of an existing task' to delete it.

Actually why not just do me a favour? Type 'bye' in the console and free both of us.
Ummm...what is that? I don't get it.
There is no task in the list.
You can't delete a task that's not in the list.
Hey, be careful.
The index must be between 1 and the size of the list, alright?
Okay...noted.
