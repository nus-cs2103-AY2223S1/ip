Hello! I'm Duke
What can I do for you?

Got it. I've added this task:
[T][ ] todo something first
1. [T][ ] todo something first
Got it. I've added this task:
[D][ ] deadline something else (by: tonight)
Got it. I've added this task:
[E][ ] event another thing (at: tmr 5pm)
1. [T][ ] todo something first
2. [D][ ] deadline something else (by: tonight)
3. [E][ ] event another thing (at: tmr 5pm)
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[T][X] todo something first
1. [T][X] todo something first
2. [D][ ] deadline something else (by: tonight)
3. [E][ ] event another thing (at: tmr 5pm)
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[T][ ] todo something first
1. [T][ ] todo something first
2. [D][ ] deadline something else (by: tonight)
3. [E][ ] event another thing (at: tmr 5pm)
Noted. I've removed this task:
[T][ ] todo something first
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
1. [D][ ] deadline something else (by: tonight)
2. [E][ ] event another thing (at: tmr 5pm)
☹ OOPS!!! I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means :-(
☹ OOPS!!! The description of a todo cannot be empty.
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
